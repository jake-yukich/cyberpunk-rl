### Motivation

A trip to your local board game store in this day and age can easily be an overstimulating experience: the boxes to choose from are so colorful and so many. Fast forward to when you have somehow successfully scheduled a group meeting with the requisite number of players to try out your new game. Hopefully what follows is fun, but this is not always the case. Sometimes it is even the game's fault that you are one wrong move away from frustrated friends flipping the table on your shiny new box.

*Cyberpunk 2077: Gangs of Night City* (the board game based on the video game) definitely has a nice box and some features that made me think it could be awesome, including assymetry, a large decision space, and a cool cyberpunk setting. (Also: nice miniatures.) The first time playing it was, however, not a success and the experience left some of my friends frazzled. Reflecting on this I could not readily pin down the reasons for the apparently wasted time and resources, so I reasoned the only way to get to the bottom of it would be to spend more time and resources to get some clarity and peace of mind.

When is complex game design also good game design? When is it not? Is *Cyberpunk*, the-video-game-the-board-game, fair?

Is it fun?

I, like any reasonable person would, attempt to ~~get my money's worth~~ answer these questions (and more) with simulations and reinforcement learning.
